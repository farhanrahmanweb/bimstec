                        “Marine Fisheries Stock Assessment, Management and Development of New Fisheries in Bay of Bengal”. The Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management in the Bay of Bengal was finished
                        in December 2007 and the full report of the said study will be published shortly. Thailand has hosted another Expert Group Meeting in which the 3 projects were discussed
                        simultaneously on 5-7 September 2005.</p>
