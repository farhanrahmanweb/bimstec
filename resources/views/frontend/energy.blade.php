                    <p>Energy sector cooperation is led by <strong>Myanmar</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The objectives of the sector are to enhance energy cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States through the establishment of BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection program to expand energy
                        trade among Member States and accelerate development of new hydro-power projects, interconnection of electricity and natural gas grids, implementation of viable renewable
                        energy projects, and sharing of experiences, knowledge and information on energy efficiency programs.

                    <p>This sector conducts its business through BIMSTEC Energy Ministers’ Meeting, Senior Officials Meeting on Energy (SOM-E) and Task Force/Expert Group Meetings. Energy
                        Ministers are supposed to meet once every two years. SOM-E is supposed to meet at least once a year to follow up on energy sector related cooperation.

                    <p>A Task Force was established for setting up of BIMSTEC Energy Centre. The MOA on the Establishment of BIMSTEC Energy Centre was signed on 22 January 2011 in Nay Pyi Taw,
                        Myanmar. The BIMSTEC Energy Centre is being hosted by India at Bengaluru.

                    <p>A Task Force on Trans Power Exchange and Development Projects was also established to develop MOU for the establishment of BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection. The finalized text
                        of the MOU is expected to be signed during the 3rd Energy Ministers’ Meeting scheduled to be held in Kathmandu, Nepal in 2018.
