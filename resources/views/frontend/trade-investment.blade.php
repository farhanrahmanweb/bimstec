                    <p>Trade and Investment was one of the initial six sectors of BIMSTEC cooperation as identified by the 2nd BIMSTEC Ministerial Meeting held in Dhaka, Bangladesh on 19 December
                        1998. Bangladesh acts as the Lead Country for this sector.

                    <p>The initial vision for BIMSTEC economic cooperation, as articulated in the 1st (Special) Ministerial Meeting held in Bangkok on 22 December 1997, had three major pillars: i)
                        close public-private partnership to promote economic cooperation; ii) identification of sectors, sub-sectors and projects for economic cooperation, and iii) elimination of
                        non-tariff and tariff barriers through government-to-government negotiations.

                    <p>Trade and Investment Sector has a well developed institutional mechanism to conduct its activities: i) Trade and Economic Ministerial Meeting (TEMM); ii) Senior Trade and
                        Economic Officials’ Meeting (STEOM); iii) Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) and its Working Groups; iv) BIMSTEC Economic Forum; and v) BIMSTEC Business Forum.

                    <p><strong>Trade and Economic Ministerial Meeting (TEMM)</strong></p>

                    <p>The Trade and Economic Ministerial Meeting (TEMM) consists of the Trade/Economic Ministers of the Member States. To date, five TEMMs have taken place:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The Fifth Meeting of the Senior Trade and Economic Officials is scheduled to be hosted by Bangladesh. At the 17th Session of the BIMSTEC Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) held
                        in Kathmandu on 07 Feb 2017, the Delegation of Bangladesh stated that the dates for the Fifth STEOM and the Sixth BIMSTEC TEMM will be notified upon completion of the
                        ongoing negotiations to conclude a number of Constituent Agreements of the BIMSTEC FTA.</p>

                    <p><strong>Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) and FTA Negotiations</strong></p>

                    <p>The Framework Agreement on the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area was signed in Phuket, Thailand on 08 February 2004 and came into force on 30 June 2004. Article 2 of the Framework
                        Agreement outlines the following areas to be covered by the “Comprehensive Free Trade Area (FTA)”:</p>

                    <ul class="list-style-3">
                        <li>Progressive elimination of tariffs and non-tariff barriers in substantially all trade in goods</li>
                        <li>Progressive liberalization of trade in services with substantial sectoral coverage</li>
                        <li>Establishing an open and competitive investment regime that facilitates and promotes investment within the BIMSTEC FTA</li>
                        <li>Establishing effective trade and investment facilitating measures, including, but not limited to, simplification of customs procedures and development of mutual
                            recognition arrangements

                        <li>Establishing appropriate mechanisms for implementation of the Agreement</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Article 10 of the Framework Agreement provided for the establishment of BIMSTEC Trade Negotiating Committee (BIMSTEC TNC) to carry out the program of negotiations as set out
                        in the Framework Agreement. Accordingly, the BIMSTEC TNC was created in 2004 (under the permanent Chairmanship of Sri Lanka) which has since held 20 rounds of negotiations,
                        the last one held in Khon Kaen, Thailand on 07-09 September 2015. While TNC itself focuses on negotiations on the Agreement on Trade in Goods, pursuant to Article 10.2 of
                        the Framework Agreement, it has created a number of Working Groups to assist in the negotiations:</p>


                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Working Group on Rules of Origin (17th meeting held in Khon Kaen, Thailand on 07-09 Sept 2015);</li>
                        <li>Working Group on Trade in Services (7th meeting held in Khon Kaen, Thailand on 07-09 Sept 2015);</li>

                        <li>Working Group on Customs Cooperation (1st meeting was held on 10-11 May 2018 in New Delhi, India);</li>
                        <li>Working Group on Trade Facilitation (1st Meeting is proposed to be held in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2018)</li>
                    </ol>


                    <p>The TNC is currently engaged in the negotiations to conclude the following Constituent Agreements/Protocols which would form integral part of the BIMSTEC FTA:</p>

                    <ol type="i">

                    </ol>
                    <p>The 21st Meeting of the BISMTEC TNC is scheduled to be held in Dhaka, Bangladesh in mid-2018, when a number of Constituent Agreements of BIMSTEC FTA are expected to be
                        finalized. It is hoped that these Agreements, in particular the Agreement on Trade in Goods would be ready to be signed by the next Trade and Economic Ministers’ Meeting
                        (TEMM), in order to trigger the operationalization of the BIMSTEC FTA.</p>


                    <p><strong> Sector participation in BIMSTEC Economic Cooperation</p></strong>

                    <p>BIMSTEC Business Forum (BBF) and BIMSTEC Economic Forum (BEF) are the two forums that allow active participation of the private sector representatives meet and discuss
                        various issues related to their interest. In the BBF, private sector representatives from the BIMSTEC Member States meet and discuss various issues. Results from the BBF
                        are submitted to the BIMSTEC Economic Forum (BEF) where the private sectors have an opportunity to discuss freely with representatives from the public sector. The BEF
                        reports the outcome of its Meetings to the STEOM.
                    </p>

                    <p>The BIMSTEC Business Forum (BBF) was formed by the representatives of private sector of BIMSTEC Member States at a meeting organized by ESCAP in Bangkok, Thailand in March
                        1998 to enhance private sector cooperation among the Member States of the BIMSTEC region in identified sectors, sub-sectors and projects. BBF held seven (7) meetings
                        between 2003 and 2016, the last meeting held in New Delhi, India on 21 July 2016. The Eighth Meeting of the BIMSTEC Business Forum is proposed to be held in Dhaka,
                        Bangladesh in 2018.</p>

                    <p>Current Members of the BIMSTEC Business Forum (BBF) are as follows:</p>

                    <p>The Second BIMST-EC Ministerial Meeting held in Dhaka, Bangladesh on 19 December 1998 emphasized on the need for establishing a BIMSTEC Economic Forum (BEF) to promote
                        Government-Private sector cooperation among the Member States. Accordingly, the process of formulation of BIMSTEC Economic Forum was initiated by Bangladesh through a
                        Preparatory Meeting on the formation of the BIMST-EC Economic Forum which was held in Dhaka in November 1999. Later, the Economic Forum met formally for the first time in
                        New Delhi, India on 03 July 2000. Both the Government Officials (from the Foreign Ministry as well as the Trade/Economic Ministry) and Private sectors (Members of the
                        BIMSTEC Business Forum) from each of the BIMSTEC Member State are the participants of the BEF. BEF have held six meetings. The Sixth Meeting of the BEF held in Bangkok,
                        Thailand on 24 February 2011 agreed that the Seventh Meeting of BEF will be held in Bangladesh back-to-back with the STEOM and TEMM.</p>
